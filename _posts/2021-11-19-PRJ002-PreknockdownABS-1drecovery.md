 ## **Objective**: 
Sample individuals that have been treated in ABS, or ABS 2 without the priming for one week in order to determine the the susceptibility of anemones to conditions and test the if concentrations used were appropriate.

## Broader Context
This will serve as preliminary data in a pre-experiment for PRJ002-Aiptasia-MM, which will allow for any needed adjustments to be made after the priming in the main experiment is complete.

## Protocol
Samples total were taken at time of sampling SAM136-138 were taken from the ABS 1 plate wells A1, B2, and C1 respectively, SAM_139-141 were taken from ABS2 plate wells A3, B2, and C1 respectively. SAM_142 was taken from the stock tanks to use as a control.

All anemones were homogenized in  300ul of Filtered ASW using a a handheld 1.5ml tube pestle.
50 ul were removed from the tube and used to plate serial dilutions of homogenate on Marine Agar plates at 10<sup>0</sup>, 10<sup>-1</sup>, and 10<sup>-2</sup> dilutions ( 50ul per plate).
Samples were spread using 5 roller beads per plate and passed through a infinity motion 20 times and left in the incubator at 30C for 24 hours.
the remaining 250 ul was transferred to a MP Biomedicals Lysing matrix E tube with the glass bead removed.
500ul of DNA/RNA shield was added to the lysing tubes and samples were bead beat at 8 m/s for 60 seconds  twice with a five minute pause between the two cycles, then frozen at -80 in Box Auntil further processing.
