**Objective:** 
Experimental Setup of microbial Knockdown project. 
## Broader Context
This project will monitor the success of microbial knockdown under two seperate Antibiotic solutions being treated fro 7 days, and will also monitor the duration for which the microbiome stays reduced. Initial sample priming will involve the reduction of the microbiome through keeping the organisms in Seawater filtered with a .22 micron filtered, and feeding with Artemia that have had their microbiome knocked down through the use of antibiotics.
### Parameters to be monitored throughout this experiment:
- CFU counts
- microbial knockdown through 16s PCR
- growth rate through change in wet weight
- pedal laceration rate 
- morphological changes through photo monitoring; 
Note the last three parameters will be monitored in individuals kept in 6 well plates for the duration of the experiment; all other individuals will be kept in 12 well plates
## Protocol 
Initial priming
