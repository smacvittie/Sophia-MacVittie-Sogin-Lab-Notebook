**Objective:** 
Experimental Setup of microbial Knockdown project. 
## Broader Context
This project will monitor the success of microbial knockdown under two seperate Antibiotic solutions being treated fro 7 days, and will also monitor the duration for which the microbiome stays reduced. Initial sample priming will involve the reduction of the microbiome through keeping the organisms in Seawater filtered with a .22 micron filtered, and feeding with Artemia that have had their microbiome knocked down through the use of antibiotics.

## Protocol
prepare stock solutions for each of the individual antibiotics

Nalidixic acid (50mg/ml)
- 2.5ml MilliQ  water
- 0.25 g nalidixic acid
- add 5M NaOH until the nalidixic acid dissolves
- bring the volume up to 5ml the pH should be about 11

Rifampicin (50mg/ml)
- 0.25g rifampicin (light sensitive wrap falcon tube in tinfoil)
- 5ml DMSO
- vortex to dissolve

Carbenicillin (50mg/ml)
- 0.25g carbenicillin
- 5ml millQ water
- vortex to dissolve

Chloramphenicol (50mg/ml)
- 2.5g chloramphenicol
- 50ml EtOH

Penicillin (50mg/ml)
- .25g penicillin
- 5ml MilliQ  water
- vortex to dissolve 

Streptomycin(50mg/ml)
- .25g streptomycin
- 5ml MilliQ  water
- vortex to dissolve

Neomycin (50mg/ml)
- .25g neomycin
- 5ml MilliQ  water
- vortex to dissolve


To make 500ml of ABS 1 (final concentration 50ug/ml) add:
- 498ml Filtered Artificial Seawater
- 500 ul nalidixic acid stock solution
- 500 ul chloramphenicol stock solution
- 500 ul carbenicillin stock solution
- 500 ul rifampicin stock solution

To make 500ml of ABS 2 (final concentration 100ug/ml) add:
- 498ml Filtered Artificial Seawater
- 1000 ul penicillin stock solution
- 1000 ul streptomycin stock solution
- 1000 ul neomycin stock solution
- 1000 ul rifampicin stock solution
