**Objective:** The purpose of this entry is to set precedent for what I'd like my Notebook to look like going forward and to create a means of organization that is clear and easy to follow.

I'll do this by establishing sections and formatting which can be filled out. See below, subject to change.

## Concluding Thoughts
