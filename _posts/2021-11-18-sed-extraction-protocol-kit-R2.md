## **Objective:** 
This is the first use of the ZymoBiomics DNA/RNA Prep minikit. We are hoping this kit will prove to be a more efficient alternative for Sediment extractions that we can use for metagenomic analyses and metabolomics. the purpose of this experiment was to test the protocol per the manufacturers instructions on our marine sediment samples collected in Bodega Bay
