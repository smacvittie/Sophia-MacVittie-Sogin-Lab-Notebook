## **Objective:** 
This Protocol aims to establish a standard Protocol for the sampling of Anemones for the Microbiome Manipulation Experiment , which we will standardize across timepoints. 

## Broader Context: 
The samples taken today (SAM_053-SAM_079) will serve as Timepoint 1 for the initial stability time series experiment on which we will base our manipulations. Our aim is to monitor over-all stability, as well as track changes to population based one new lab conditions. 

## Protocol
Protocol followed the same procedure as the experiment on [Sept. 21st](Sophia-MacVittie-Sogin-Lab-Notebook/_posts/2021-09-21-Aiptasia-sampling-protocol-t0.md) with the following modification. The samples were run on the bead beater at 8m/s for two rounds of 60sec with a 5 minute pause interval between.
In addition, for water sampling the procedure for twater from tanks remained the same. However for sampling the ASW from the source 1L was filterd throu a 0.22 micron filter by pushing 60ml through at a time with a sterile luerlock syringe. 
Filter ends were sealed with parafilm before freezing thr filter whole at -80 with the other samples.
