**Objective:** The objective of this experiment is to optimize an extraction protocol for marine seagrass associated sediment microbial communities. This is a 2 day (September 13th and 14th) process part of a larger multi-day experiment which will work to adjust this protocol to maximize Nucleic acid output. It is adapted from [Lever et. al 2015](./file:/Sophia-Macvittie-Sogin-lab-notebook/protocols/Lever%20et.%20al%202015.pdf).

## Broader Context
This Protocol will simultaneously be compared to the zymobiomics DNA/RNA extraction kit. by using one of these protocols we will develop a reliable method for the extraction of seagrass associated microbes for Marine sediments, which we will be able to use in future experimentation.

## Protocol 
Using the below protocol we will compare 2 sediment samples taken from the same site but treated with diffeent preservation methods. 3 replicats per sample will be tested (n=3). The first treatment involved the direct and immediate freezing of sediment samples on dry ice these samples will be annotated as F1-F3. in the second method, zymoshield was added to the samples and allowed to sit for about an hour before freezing on Dry ice, annotated as Z1-Z3,

**1. Sample preparation**

a) Thaw samples over ice and keep on ice until flash freezing begins

b)add 0.2 g sample to a pre-filled bead beating tube (lysis matrix B, 0.1mm silicate bead)

c) Add 500ul of a 0.04M solution Sodium Hexametaphosphate over ice, pipette up and down to mix 

**2. Lysis**

a) add 500 μL lysis Solution I, gently pipette up and down to mix

b) Flash Freeze sample in liquid nitrogen or Dry-ice ( if unavailable use a -80 15-20 min)

c) Thaw sample

d) Bead beat for 30s

e) Incubate at 50°C in for 1 hour, using the thermomixer at 500 rpm

f) Flash Freeze sample in liquid nitrogen or Dry-ice

g) Thaw sample

h) vortex for 10 s

i) Incubate at 50°C in for 1 hour, using the thermomixer at 500 rpm

j) Add Lysis II

k) Flash Freeze sample in liquid nitrogen or Dry-ice. 

l)Thaw sample

m) vortex for 10 s

n) Incubate at 65°C in for 1 hour, using the thermomixer at 500 rpm

**3. Purification**

a) Centrifuge 15 minutes at 10,000xg and 4°C.

b) Transfer supernatant to a clean microcentrifuge tube.

c) Add 1 volume of CI vortex at max speed for 10 s 

d) Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 10,000xg and 4°C

e) Transfer aqueous supernatant to clean microcentrifuge tube

f) Repeat c-e

**4. Precipitation**

a) Add LPA (20μL/ml final concentration) to sample and homogenize.

b) Homogenize sample with 0.1 volumes of 5 M NaCl solution followed by 1.5 volumes of isopropanol using a vortex, ensure samples look well combined 

c) Incubate in the dark at -20°C for minimum 2h or overnight.

d) Centrifuge at 1400xg for 30 minutes at 4°C then pipette off the supernatant to leave the pellet, supernatant can be discarded

e) To remove isopropanol, pellets precipitated by isopropanol-containing solution are washed once with 100 microlitres 70% ethanol,centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000×g, 

f) following centrifugation dry sample using the speed vac. turn off any temperature settings. us D-AQ mode, it should take 30 - 40 minutes

g) Dissolve pellet in 200μL of nucleotide free water. Vortex to dissolve. 

**5. Clean-up:**
Fraction sample for DNA and RNA (100μl/ tube) follow the below protocol for DNA and RNA

DNA | RNA
-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------
1.add 500μl of Binding Buffer H to each sample. | 1. prepare the appropriate volume of buffer H by adding 10μl of betamercaptoethanol to each 1 ml added. ex. for 6 samples add 15μl to 1.5ml; addd 250 microlitres to each sample.
2.Vortex the sample to mix well | 2. vortex the sample
3.assemble a column and collection tube for each sample | 3. add 200μl of 96-100% EtOH
4.apply the 600μl  of sample to the column | 4. vortex for 10 seconds
5.centrifuge for 1 minute | 5. apply the full volume of the sample to the spin column 
6.Discard Flow Through | 6. Centrifuge for 1 minute, 
7.Place spin column back into the collection tube and add 500μl  of Wash Solution K | 7. Discard Flow through
8.centrifuge for 2 minutes at 14,000xg | 8. place spin column back into the collection tube and add 500μl of Wash solution K
9.Discard flowthrough and centrifuge for an additional minute, ensure the column is completely dry | 9. centrifuge for 1 minute ensuring the entire volume has passed through the tube (spin an additional minute if needed
10.discard flow-through and collection tube| 10. discard flow through
11.Insert column into the elution tube|11. place spin column back into the collection tube and add 500μl of Wash solution K
12.Add 50μl of elution Buffer L|12. centrifuge for 2 minute ensuring the entire volume has passed through the tube (spin an additional minute if needed
13.centrifuge for 2 minutes at 200xg followed by 1 minute at 14,000xg|13. discard collection tube with flow through
14.Add an additional 50μl of Buffer L|14. place column into an elution tube and add 25μl of elution buffer L
15.Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 200xg followed by 1 minute at 14,000xg|15. centrifuge for 2 minutes at 200xg followed by 1 minute at 14,000xg

## Concluding Thoughts
**Protocol modifications.**

- Zymo containing sediment sample is far more dificult to move into the bead beating tubes. in future sample prep I'd reccomend a lower volume addition if that ends up being the more impactful preservation method. 

- Step 1C. the addition of 500 microlitres is to large a volume. I would reccomend the addition of about 200 for the next round.
